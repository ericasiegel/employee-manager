# Employee Manager

## Description 

This is a back-end projected developed with node.js to create a database containing employee names, departments, and job roles. This application uses the command line in the user's Terminal to view, update, and delete employees, departments,  and roles. These questions are prompted using the [Inquirer Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). After the user enters prompted information and selections the database is then updated with that information.

Using the command line, the user is able to make a connection to the server where they are prompted to view all departments, employees, roles, employees by department, or employees by manager. They can add a new department, role, and employee as well as update the employee's role and/or manager. If they would like to delete a department, employee or role they have that option as well.
